# roma_utilities

This repo contains utilities scripts used to complement the ease of use and automation some types of simulations within the [AgroSwarm simulator](https://github.com/CSCarbone07/roma_quad_ai).

The shell_additions come originally from the repo [MRS UAV system core](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/uav_core).
