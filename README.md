# roma_utilities

This repo contains utilities scripts used to complement the ease of use and automation some types of simulations within the [AgroSwarm simulator](https://github.com/CSCarbone07/roma_quad_ai).

The shell_additions come originally from the repo [MRS UAV system core](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/uav_core).

## Implementation

To make sure your system is considering these scripts download them with the following commands:

```
mkdir ~/git
```
```
cd ~/git
```
```
git clone git@github.com:CSCarbone07/roma_utilities.git
```

and then source them by adding the following line to your *~/.bashrc* file:

```
source $HOME/git/roma_utilities/shell_additions/shell_additions.sh
```

now these scripts will be considered by new opened terminals.
